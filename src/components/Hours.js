            Everything is tied together with a massive, rectangular, marble bar, which stands in the center of the restaurant, naturally separating the eating and drinking areas. High stools line one of its sides, while comfortable chairs can be found on the other end, for those who prefer to eat at the bar instead of a table. The back also features an open kitchen complete with a traditional scale, which we use to measure our hefty portions of fresh meat and seafood.
