              Besides providing you with products of the finest quality, superior service and refined design,
              El Ninot is also committed to expanding the cultural offer of Barcelona. Once a month we organize,
              Arta a la cuina, a fun event featuring an exhibit by local, up-and-coming artists. The pieces remain
              on our walls for the following weeks and the work is available for purchase that night and during the
              following month, leading up to the next showcase. Keep a lookout for more information about our Art a
              la cuina events on our social media channels.
